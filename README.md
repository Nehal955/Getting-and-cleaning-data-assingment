README y_test y_train ‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector. * - ‘features.txt’: List of all features. * - ‘activity_labels.txt’: Links the class labels with their activity name. * - ‘train/X_train.txt’: Training set. * - ‘train/y_train.txt’: Training labels. * - ‘test/X_test.txt’: Test set. *- ‘test/y_test.txt’: Test labels

Analysis shows that you can categorize the data into 4 segments * training set * test set * features * activity labels

Inertial Signal data is not required. Additionally, features and activity label are more for tagging and descriptive than data sets.
